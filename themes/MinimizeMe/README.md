# MinimizeMe!
![](https://github.com/dvcky/BetterDiscord/raw/master/themes/MinimizeMe/MinimizeMe.gif)

Minimizes sidebars for more screen real-estate. Helpful for people that are using vertical screens, or simply just want more of the chat to be shown most of the time. Should be "layer-able" with other themes, given that they don't mess with the size or positioning of the sidebars.

## Changelog
**v1.3.1:** Added "Active Now" sidebar, fixed server channel list bug, and added "delay" variable that user can change if they wish.

## Installation
Either install through [ThemeRepo]()(TBD), [BetterDiscord's official theme page]()(TBD), or [manually through my repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvcky/BetterDiscord/master/themes/MinimizeMe/MinimizeMe.theme.css).

If you download through BetterDiscord's official theme page or my repository, you need to manually place the theme in the themes folder. To do this, simply:
1. Open Discord
2. Click "User Settings"
3. Click "Themes"
4. Click "Open Themes Folder" (This should open the folder that you need to place the file you downloaded in, place the file there)
5. Click the toggle for the now-visible theme in Discord. Congratz, you did it!
